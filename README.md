# Actuator Control
MELODEE implmements two FIRGELLI "Super Duty Actuators" in her excavation system. These actuatotors are going to be powered by a motor controller fused with our custom Arduino PCB hat. In order to effectively control these actuators, the hall effect sensor data in both of the units have to be monitered and an external limit switch implemented so the arm linkages do not go pass the mechanical limits that the actuators would have no way of knowing are there.
